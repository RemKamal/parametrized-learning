abstract = {The paper is concerned with methods for the estimation of the coalescence time (time since the most recent common ancestor) of a sample of intraspecies DNA sequences. The methods take advantage of prior knowledge of population demography, in addition to the molecular data. While some theoretical results are presented, a central focus is on computational methods. These methods are easy to implement, and, since explicit formulae tend to be either unavailable or unilluminating, they are also more useful and more informative in most applications. Extensions are presented that allow for the effects of uncertainty in our knowledge of population size and mutation rates, for variability in population sizes, for regions of different mutation rate, and for inference concerning the coalescence time of the entire population. The methods are illustrated using recent data from the human Y chromosome.},

@article{Gutmann2014,
abstract = {Statistical modeling of data is an integral part of science. Increasingly complex models are being used as they allow for realistic data generation, but a common difficulty with them is the prohibitively large computational cost to perform likelihood-based inference. In stochastic dynamical systems, for example, latent variables render the likelihood function intractable but simulating observations from the model is feasible. A likelihood-free inference framework has been proposed where the model parameters are identified by finding values yielding simulated data that resemble the observed data. For Bayesian inference, the framework is known as approximate Bayesian computation; for point-estimation generally as indirect inference. We address here one of the open key problems in this framework: the assessment of how similar the observed and simulated data are. Currently, the comparison is often based on subjectively chosen summary statistics and the goal of this paper is to enable a more objective analysis of similarity. Our approach uses the discriminability (classifiability) of the observed and simulated data as discrepancy measure. The problem of choosing an appropriate similarity measure is thereby reduced to a classification problem where we can leverage on effective existing solutions. The validity of our approach is analyzed theoretically and demonstrated for both point estimation and Bayesian inference on synthetic data and real data with an individual-based epidemic model for bacterial infections in day care centers.},

abstract = {Abstract Large sample properties of the likelihood function when the true parameter value may be on the boundary of the parameter space are described. Specifically, the asymptotic distribution of maximum likelihood estimators and likelihood ratio statistics are derived. These results generalize the work of Moran (1971), Chant (1974), and Chernoff (1954). Some of Chant's results are shown to be incorrect. The approach used in deriving these results follows from comments made by Moran and Chant. The problem is shown to be asymptotically equivalent to the problem of estimating the restricted mean of a multivariate Gaussian distribution from a sample of size 1. In this representation the Gaussian random variable corresponds to the limit of the normalized score statistic and the estimate of the mean corresponds to the limit of the normalized maximum likelihood estimator. Thus the limiting distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator is the same as the distribution of the projection of the Gaussian random v...},

@article{Anisimova2006,
abstract = {We revisit statistical tests for branches of evolutionary trees reconstructed upon molecular data. A new, fast, approximate likelihood-ratio test (aLRT) for branches is presented here as a competitive alternative to nonparametric bootstrap and Bayesian estimation of branch support. The aLRT is based on the idea of the conventional LRT, with the null hypothesis corresponding to the assumption that the inferred branch has length 0. We show that the LRT statistic is asymptotically distributed as a maximum of three random variables drawn from the chi(0)2 + chi(1)2 distribution. The new aLRT of interior branch uses this distribution for significance testing, but the test statistic is approximated in a slightly conservative but practical way as 2(l1- l2), i.e., double the difference between the maximum log-likelihood values corresponding to the best tree and the second best topological arrangement around the branch of interest. Such a test is fast because the log-likelihood value l2 is computed by optimizing only over the branch of interest and the four adjacent branches, whereas other parameters are fixed at their optimal values corresponding to the best ML tree. The performance of the new test was studied on simulated 4-, 12-, and 100-taxon data sets with sequences of different lengths. The aLRT is shown to be accurate, powerful, and robust to certain violations of model assumptions. The aLRT is implemented within the algorithm used by the recent fast maximum likelihood tree estimation program PHYML (Guindon and Gascuel, 2003).},

@techreport{Garcia1995,
abstract = {The Markov Switching Model, introduced by Hamilton (1988, 1989), has been used in various economic and financial applications where changes in regime play potentially an important role. While estimation methods for these models are by now well established, such is not the case for the corresponding testing procedures. The Markov switching models raise a special problem known in the statistics literature as testing hypotheses in models where a nuisance parameter is not identified under the null hypothesis. In these circumstances, the asymptotic distributions of the usual tests (likelihood ratio, Lagrange multiplier, Wald tests) are non-standard. In this paper, we show that, if we treat the transition probabilities as nuisance parameters in a Markov switching model and set the null hypothesis in terms uniquely of the parameters governed by the Markov variable, the distributional theory proposed by Hansen (1991a) is applicable to Markov switching models under certain assumptions. Based on this framework, we derive analytically, in the context of two-state Markov switching models, the asymptotic null distribution of the likelihood ratio test (which is shown to be also valid for the Lagrange multiplier and Wald tests under certain conditions) and the related covariance functions. Monte Carlo simulations show that the asymptotic distributions offer a very good approximation to the corresponding empirical distributions. Les mod\`{e}les \`{a} changements de r\'{e}gime markoviens soul\`{e}vent un probl\`{e}me particulier connu dans la litt\'{e}rature statistique sous la rubrique des tests d'hypoth\`{e}se dans les mod\`{e}les o\`{u} un param\`{e}tre de nuisance n'est pas identifi\'{e} sous l'hypoth\`{e}se nulle. Dans ces cas, les distributions asymptotiques des tests usuels (ratio de vraisemblance, multiplicateur de Lagrange, Wald) ne sont pas standard. Dans le pr\'{e}sent article, nous montrons que, si nous traitons les probabilit\'{e}s de transition comme des param\`{e}tres de nuisance dans un mod\`{e}le \`{a} changements de r\'{e}gime markoviens et fixons l'hypoth\`{e}se nulle uniquement en fonction des param\`{e}tres r\'{e}gis par la variable de Markov, la th\'{e}orie distributionnelle propos\'{e}e par Hansen (1991) est applicable aux mod\`{e}les \`{a} changements de r\'{e}gime markoviens sous certaines hypoth\`{e}ses. Dans ce cadre, nous d\'{e}rivons analytiquement la distribution asymptotique du ratio de vraisemblance sous l'hypoth\`{e}se nulle ainsi que les fonctions de covariance correspondantes pour divers mod\`{e}les \`{a} changements de r\'{e}gime markoviens : un mod\`{e}le \`{a} 2 moyennes avec erreurs non corr\'{e}l\'{e}es et homosc\'{e}dastiques; un mod\`{e}le \`{a} 2 moyennes avec des erreurs suivant un processus AR(r) ; et finalement un mod\`{e}le \`{a} 2 moyennes et 2 variances avec des erreurs non corr\'{e}l\'{e}es. Dans les trois cas, des exp\'{e}riences de Monte Carlo montrent que les distributions asymptotiques d\'{e}riv\'{e}es offrent une tr\`{e}s bonne approximation de la distribution empirique. La d\'{e}rivation de la distribution asymptotique de la statistique du ratio de vraisemblance pour ces trois mod\`{e}les simples markoviens \`{a} 2 \'{e}tats sera utile pour \'{e}valuer la signification statistique des r\'{e}sultats qui sont apparus dans la litt\'{e}rature et plus g\'{e}n\'{e}ralement pour offrir un ensemble de valeurs critiques aux chercheurs futurs dans ce domaine. Les valeurs critiques de la distribution asymptotique du test du ratio de vraisemblance dans les mod\`{e}les \`{a} changements de r\'{e}gime markoviens sont consid\'{e}rablement plus \'{e}lev\'{e}es que les valeurs critiques impliqu\'{e}es par la distribution chi-carr\'{e} standard.},

While a complete description of power for each size ? is more informative than ESL, it is argued that ESL is often a reasonable compromise between high ideals and practicability. Section 4 gives two estimation methods for Monte Carlo simulation of ESL and shows how to estimate variances and covariances for the second of these methods. The first method leads to the familiar Wilcoxon two-sample statistic which is clearly a sample analogue of ESL. The second and more apposite method leads to a modification of the Wilcoxon statistic.},

abstract = {We describe likelihood-based statistical tests for use in high energy physics for the discovery of new phenomena and for construction of confidence intervals on model parameters. We focus on the properties of the test procedures that allow one to account for systematic uncertainties. Explicit formulae for the asymptotic distributions of test statistics are derived using results of Wilks and Wald. We motivate and justify the use of a representative data set, called the "Asimov data set", which provides a simple method to obtain the median experimental sensitivity of a search or measurement as well as fluctuations about this expectation.},
